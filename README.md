# Node Boilerplate
This is a fully open source code snippet. The idea is to download it and make a copy of (then rename and edit). The original comments explain each line of code and what they are doing; I'd recommend if you can explain this line of code than get rid of it before making a copy, else keep it since it will be helpful while revisiting code.
